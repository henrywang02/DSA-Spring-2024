## 1. Introduction

- Data is a very new field to me. I am considered as a newbie in this area. However, with Data Analyst position, Data Structure and Algorithms is a really important part. Thank to this, I can know how the data function and work with it effectively. The purpose of this self assessment is to help me have a better understanding the field (Data Anlyst) and is like the tool to help me to deal with the big data smoothl by many ways (Like storing, oraganizing, and processing).

## 2. Skills

- Fortunately, I had a chance to get access with some data-related courses in Datacamp. I can have the ability to illustrate graphs through the math. I can know which math function should be used to display the graphs. Moreover, thank to the logicals of the data flow, I can keep it up very easily. Applying Python, Numpy, Panda, Dictionaries in Data field to solve many problem is not a matter to me. Therefore, I really passionate with this field.
- Talking about the weakness, I am studying coding about 1 years ago. Back then, I had never have a chance to get access to coding, so when I try to code, everything is feel strange to me. I am just like start everything from 0. Everything I learn is one by one. Therefore, I try to search google, searching tools many times when coding. 

## 3. Learning

- Talking about the skills related to data, I am greate skills in Python, Data Visualisations, and Excel. These are the things I learned from school and by myself in the first year at JAMK. Therefore, when I register the data stuctures and algorithms course. I think I can go for it without having many barriers.

## 4. Objectives

- My main objectives after studying this course is to have a general understanding about data structures and algorithms. From this course, I can know many different way to cope with data and I can handle more smoothly. There are many things waiting me like Trees, some Graphs, Hashing, Dynamic Programming, Graph Algorithms, Machine Learning Algorithms, and more. These are all the things I absolutely achieve in this course to a master in this field.

## 5. Conclusion

In conclusion, studying the new skills in this course is a new barrier I want to challenge myself and applying all the old ones I studied before will give me a wide vision in this area. The first peak I want to be on is a master in Data Anlyst and Data Scientist will be the second ambition that I will be then.
