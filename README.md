### Data Structures and Algorithms Overview
As part of my studies at JAMK University of Applied Sciences, I explored Data Structures and Algorithms extensively, primarily using Python. This coursework provided me with a strong understanding of fundamental data structures, their implementation, and their role in optimizing algorithms.

One of the most engaging projects I worked on involved comparing List and Binary Search Tree (BST) data structures in sorting algorithms. Through this project, I:

- Researched the efficiency of Lists and BSTs in different scenarios.
- Implemented sorting algorithms like Quick Sort and Merge Sort to evaluate performance.
- Analyzed and compared the time complexity and memory usage of each data structure.
- Visualized results to draw conclusions about their suitability for various applications.

This project deepened my understanding of algorithmic efficiency, enabling me to apply the right data structure for specific tasks. It also strengthened my problem-solving skills and reinforced the importance of computational thinking.
